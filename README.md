# cargo-tanker
Crate to create great project structure for Rust

This crate (cargo subcommand) to create a folder structure for new projects, speeding up the development process and improving the workflow.

The subcommand automates the creation of the necessary file structure, allowing developers to focus on writing code instead of setting up the project.

This custom subcommand is a convenient tool for Rustaceans, making it easier and faster to start new projects and streamlining the development process.

> **WARNING !** : Don't run on existing project, it could mess up

## Example Command

```bash
# assuming `cargo new your-project` and `cd your-project` run
cargo tanker rest-api
```
